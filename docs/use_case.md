The Reviewer as a user has multiple roles in the system. They will log onto the system through Marist CAS Authentication. They will validate tagged sentences as correct or incorrect. If determined incorrect, they will choose the rule the sentence violates. The system has a reputation system in which the user can gain reputation through correctly validating sentences that agree with majority of votes.  The reviewer can lose reputation by incorrectly validating sentences that do not agree with majority of votes. The reviewer is able to view their reputation score on the rank progress bar. They can also see if there reputation score is one of the highest by looking at the leaderboard. The leaderboard displays the top three reputation scores. The Admin as a user can view visual statistics about the system including total users on the system, latest activity, and what operating system the users are reviewing on. Also, the Admin can review AI tables and charts to get information on training models.
