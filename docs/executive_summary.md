The Writing Advising Reviewing Tool is a web application created for a Fall 2019 senior capping project at Marist College. The members of the team include Samantha DiMaio, Dayna Eidle, Daniel Gisolfi, Lauren Urena-Clark, and Alissa Systma. Our client is Dr. Pablo Rivas, who is also the professor for the capping course. Throughout the semester, our team has taken on a number of roles including setting up, designing, developing, integrating, managing, implementating and documenting the system. The tool will be utilized by the Marist College Writing Center as an efficient way to review essay sentences. The writing center takes pride in assisting students with their papers, brainstorming to create new ideas, and ultimately educating students on how to correctly edit their papers. Our project places strong emphasis on the idea of "how to correctly edit their papers." This is the start to a project that has the potential to expand into a full editing system. Currently, our system focuses on the efficiency of the smallest component of a student's paper: the sentences. The rewiewer will review sentences that have been tagged by the system. It is up to their own critique to classify the sentence as incorrect or correct. If incorrect, the reviewer can choose which rule the sentence violates. The five rules available to select from include Spelling, Verbs, Introductory Phrases, Nouns, and Consiceness. The system was designed so that if rules need to be added or deleted as per the writing center's standards, it may be done. The Reviewer also has oppotunity to earn reputation points through their sentence reviews. The system is designed to be simple, functional, and user friendly. The Reviewer has the ability to advance skills in editing by using our system. In the long run, they are also contributing to benefiting the users who create these sentences.
