1. Anticipate changes from the client
   1. There were situations mentioned above where the client introduced new requirements. We learned to always expect there can be changes to the initial requirements so we can best prepare for them. By preparing for alterations, there will be less of a setback when it actually occurs. 
2. Plan with more time than needed 
   1. Originally we set up the schedule plan to finish specific work days before official deadlines. In doing this, we were able to get ahead of sceduele. This proved critical when we had our major setback and was one of the reasons we were able to resume back on track. This also left time for us to review code and make last fixes. 
3. Ensure requirements are understood 
   1. After reviewing initial requirements, the team had many questions. This led us to go back and clarify with the client, which ultimately led to more requirements and bit more confusion. This taught us to ensure we understand what is being asked from the start. 
4. Constantly communicate with team
   1. From the project start, the team set up a communication plan. We decided on a time we would meet every week. We also exchanged phone numbers, made a group chat, and created a slack channel. This would allow us to be in constant contact with one another in and out of the classroom. This ultimately brough us closer together not only as co-workers but as friends that could collaborate effectively. We learned that open communication leads to a more comfortable working environment and the creation of a more efficient system. 
5. Never be afraid to ask for help
   1. In carrying out a project, we learned that the best results stem from asking for help. We learned that you can try your best but sometimes guidance from a team member goes a long way. Also, this is the whole reason why we are on a team, to guide one another and help learn from one another. 
6. Voice your thoughts and opinons
   1. Working with a team on a project where everyone has different personalities and skills, it can be hard to voice one's opinion. We learned that to work with a team means we must always be upfront and voice our thoughts which leads to more knowledge and better outcomes.  
7. Google Slides Only
   1. During the first week of presenting our weekly updates (that was completed on a Power Point, the power point failed to open and we had to resort to alternative forms of. We learned the lesson of not only use google slides only, but always have a back up. Presentations will not always turn out the way you expect them too, especially in the world of technology where live demos are risky. We learned to always have a back-up plan.
