**Meeting with client #1 (8/30)**

Summary: The purpose of this meeting is to understand background of the project, gather inital requirements from the client, ask questions to further understand the requirements. We established means of communication with the client for outside scedueled meeting time. Below are the questions asked: 

A.  *What is the program?*

​        i.     There’s a prototype for an online writing center program for uploading essays and getting critiques on those essays. The task is to create a web app so that reviewers can go on and correct sentences that students have tagged.

B.  *What does tagging mean?*

​        i.     When the system corrects a student’s essay, the student will tag a sentence if they think that it was correct (incorrectly marked as wrong) for further review by the reviewer.

C. *So reviewers are going to see what the student tagged and what the computer marked as wrong?*

​        i.     No. It should be ambiguous so the reviewer will know that the sentence was marked as incorrect by the computer and tagged by the student for further review, but they won’t know why it was originally marked as incorrect.

D.  *What are some main features that you want included?*

​        i.     There are 5 main criteria (provided by the writing center) for whether or not a sentence is correct. Reviewers should be able to see those 5 criteria and base their review on the criteria. I would also like AI to be incorporated into the program so that the computer will learn for further essays what is correct and what is incorrect based on past reviews from reviewers. It would also be nice if graphs based on site statistics were displayed. There should also be an about page about your team. For reviewers, I want there to be an incentive to correct sentences so reviewers gain reputation based on their corrections and if multiple people had the same corrections.

E.  *How many people correct the sentences?*

​        i.     Sentences are definitively declared wrong or right if they have 5 votes from reviewers that completely agree (either all yes or all no) or if there are more than 5 votes, ¾ of the votes must be in agreement for the sentence to be marked right or wrong.

F.  *Is login necessary for this site?*

​        i.     Yes, it should use Marist Authentication to sign in.

G.  *What type of design would you like the web app to follow?*

​        i.     It needs to be simple and functional so that it’s easy to use for the users and reviewers. It should also be lightweight and fast.

H.  *What type of environment should we develop this in?*

​        i.     It should be a Linux environment

I.  *Are there any specific requirements for the database?*

​        i.     Yes. It needs to be in Postgres or MySQL and queries need to be secure across the servers.

**Meeting with client #5 (9/27)**

Summary: The purpose of this meeting was to review the Entity-Relational Diagram. The Client brought up the question of what if another rule was added? Our current database did not have a rules table to easily integrate another rule into the system. This led to a total renovation of the current ERD. It also led to an entire re-do of most of the progress made for database functionalities and API controls.

**Meeting with client #7 (10/11)**
