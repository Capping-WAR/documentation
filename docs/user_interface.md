The Sentence Reviewer component is the center of the front landing page. It will display sentences that have been tagged for review. The reviewer can select correct if they believe the sentence is correct. If they believe the sentence contains an error, the user can select incorrect and check off the rule(s) they believe the sentence violates. Another sentences will keep appearing once marked.  

**Display of Rules** 

![Rules Display](./assets/image-20191120201911454.png)

Below the sentence review section there is a display of the rules. It shows each rule with a drop down explaining the rule and what a violation of that rule entails. This will help the reviewer understand more clearly if they are unsure whether or not a rule pertains to a tagged sentence. 

**Leaderboard and Ranking System**

**![Leaderboard](./assets/image-20191120202009656.png)**

On the left side of the front landing page there is a leaderboard and a rank component underneath. The leaderboard corresponds to the reputation system of the application. Reputation is earned through correctly reviewing a sentence (as correct or incorrect in accordance to agreement with majority of rewiewer's votes for a specific rule). If a submitted review meets this criteria, the reviewer gains 10 points. If the review does not meet this criteria, the reviewer loses 10 points. The Reviewer themself and the other Top 2 Reviewer's, based on the highest reputation, will be displayed on the leaderboard along with their current scores. The ranking will show what the userâ€™s current score is. This allows the user's to see where they stand alongside the top Reviewer's in the system.

#### Theme

As per the clients request, the theme for the Writing Advisor Review tool is simple, functional, and user-friendly. Simple design has many advantages over complicated designs. They are easier for the user to navigate as well as easier for the developer to make fixes. We wanted to ensure the reviewer will not be overwhelmed when using our system as they need to focus to make proper judgements. We designed the system in darkmode for two main reasons. The first reason is that darkmode is very simple and astetically pleasing. Users want to use an application that they find appealing. The second reason takes into account the specific users of the system. Research has proven darkmode to be extremely beneficial in helping reduce headaches, dry eyes, headaches, and eyestrain. We want to promote minimal heath risk to the users on our system, as we recongnize this is their job and they could potentially spend hours using our system. Darkmode will prove extremely beneficial to reviewers reading many sentences a day.
